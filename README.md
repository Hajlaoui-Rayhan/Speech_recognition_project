# Speech_recognition_project
A deep learning model for an Automatic Speech Recognition system using WARDEN dataset and using the TensorFlow deep learning library.
-	Loading the WARDEN dataset in TensorFlow
-	Data preprocessing: Transforming the wave files into spectrograms using the stft(short time Fourier transform) function.
-	Implementing and evaluating our Convolution Neural Network choosing the cross-entropy as the cost function and Adam Optimizer as the optimization algorithm.
-	Calculating the accuracy and plotting the confusion matrix
